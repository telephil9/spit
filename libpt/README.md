# libpt

Pretty text.  Rendering pretty text in 9front is not that easy, this
project aims at providing libraries for low- and high-level text
rendering that produces GOOD LOOKING text.

## Testing

Put your favourite font as `font.ttf` and run:

```
mk && ./6.test font.ttf README.md
```

Click with right mouse button and drag up/down or press `-` and
`+` to change font size.

Middle mouse button moves the text around.

Pressing `i` inverts the color scheme.

`Up`/`down` changes gamma (contrast?) correction. `Enter` resets it.
